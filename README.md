# Timestamps to Myriad
This script aims to convert timestamps converted from compatible DAWs (such as Ableton Live) at (https://timestamps.me)[https://timestamps.me] to the .cue file format Myriad Playout by Broadcast Radio uses. This is to enable people who create pre-made music mixes as flat files to add time markers in their DAW for each song/link and have Myriad update OCP with the correct track details.
